# Intro to NumPy and OpenCV Session Requirements

1. Download Python and setup VSCode. You can use this [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUAK4x_7thA&ab_channel=HarsivoEdu).
2. Go through these [Python Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_intro.asp) up until Functions (takes about an hour if you have zero python knowledge)

    - **Note**: Make sure to run some of the tutorial code in VSCode to make sure your python installation works.

3. Download Jupyter notebook using the `pip install jupyter notebook` command as shown [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McAn3vUDQKw&ab_channel=AhmadVarasteh).

    - You should be able to skip the first two sections of the video, however if the pip command doesn't work, follow the "Installing pip" section of the video

4. Ready for the Session!

## Note:

-   It is **imperative** that you finish these objectives before the session.
